Newsletter Double Opt-In Module for Odoo
========================================

This module adds a double opt-in workflow for newsletter registrations, ensuring that subscribers confirm their subscription before receiving any newsletters.\
This helps to reduce spam complaints and improve the quality of your mailing list and also aligns your company with the GDPR.


Configuration
-------------

To configure the Newsletter Double Opt-In module, follow these steps:

1. Install the module in your Odoo instance.
2. If you would like to disable the double opt-in workflow for a specific mailing list, navigate to the mailing list and edit its settings.
3. In the Mailing List Settings, you will find an option to enable/disable the Double Opt-In feature for the mailing list. By default, the Double Opt-In feature is enabled for all mailing lists.


Usage
-----

To use this module, simply install it in your Odoo instance. By default, all new mass mailing subscriptions will be set to opt-out on creation, and a confirmation email will be sent to the contact. The contact will only receive newsletters after they have clicked the confirmation link in the email. 

If you would like to disable the double opt-in workflow for a specific mailing list, you can configure the settings in the mailing list itself. However, we recommend keeping the double opt-in feature enabled to reduce spam complaints and improve the quality of your mailing list.

The opt-out status of a subscription will be removed automatically when the confirmation link is clicked, allowing the contact to start receiving newsletters from your mailing list.
